# Usage
Please open the website in Firefox. If you are on mac, note you might need to change a keyboard settings. See the know issues for more information.

# Known issues
- Only Firefox accepts a fieldset being displayed as flexbox or grid. 
    - Chrome will render the content as being default divs, possible workarounds:
        - Change the fieldset into a regular div. "Fake" the legend
        - Use floats instead
- Firefox on OSX is respecting the system setting under "keyboard -> combinations" and will by default only tab through input fields. Changing this setting will allow to tab through link elements as well
