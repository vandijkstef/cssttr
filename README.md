# CSS To the rescue
This repo contains everything regarding CSS to the rescue.
[Styleguide](styleguide.html)

## Usage
Please open the website in Firefox. If you are on mac, note you might need to change a keyboard settings. See the know issues for more information.

# Known issues
* Only Firefox accepts a fieldset being displayed as flexbox or grid. 
    * Chrome will render the content as being default divs, possible workarounds:
        * Change the fieldset into a regular div. "Fake" the legend
        * Use floats instead
* Firefox on OSX is respecting the system setting under "keyboard -> combinations" and will by default only tab through input fields. Changing this setting will allow to tab through link elements as well
